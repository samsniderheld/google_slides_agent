  2. Shape (TEXT_BOX) [g2ecab50af76_12_4630] → text: Page chapter slide
  3. Shape (TEXT_BOX) [g2ecab50af76_12_4631] → text: We shift industries forward and pave the path towards ambitious outcomes so our clients and our people can realize their full potential for growth.


  Output Text:

    "slide_type": "Page chapter slide"
    "slide_description": "This is a page chapter slide. It has a title, a chapter number, and some brief text explaining the chapter. User at after a chapter slide or a new chapter slide.",
  }
